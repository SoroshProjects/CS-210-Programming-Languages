# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, I have created a file that holds the information about animals that they want to track using RFID chips. User can add an animal, delete an animal,
save animal's data and display the available animal's data from the file.

# What did you do particularly well?
I was able to implement all the requested functionalities that effectively do the tasks.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I have created this code in a very short period and clearly shows that an intermediate programmer has created this software.
There are easier or even more efficient ways to accomplish this task. 

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
When I started to work on this project, I have not had any idea about how to design this program and what is the effective logic for this program that is 
easy to follow and implement. I have put lots of time and research into this project and I have finally gained the results that I was hoped for. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Almost everything. I have learned a lot with this project, and it has taught me different possible ways of accomplishing tasks.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to use classes and functions to be able to assign different tasks to the different functions in the program.
